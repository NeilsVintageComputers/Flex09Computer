ReadmeDisks
There are a lot of Flex disk images on the Internet however as Flex was configured for the hardware it would run on not all will work on any particular system. 
Theoretically any disks that were configured to run on one of the SWTPC 6809 computers have a good chance of working on my computer, but even then there are variances in the hardware configuration of a SWTPC system.  
This is just normal for computer systems of this era, so some programs you find will work and some wont, some can be made to work (if you have the skills of the computer enthusiasts of the 80's), some would be very difficult.  
This is a era where you wouldn't say CAN'T be "patched" to work as there were many very clever programmers that could do almost anything if they really needed to !
.
Theses disks are from the collection of disks I had saved from the 1980's as used on my original Flex based computer build.
The images are in SSSD 35track format, the lowest capacity flex format, so can be written to any disk drive you choose to use.  I wrote them to 720k disks using the greaseweazle.
The greaseweazle disk definitions for all the common flex formats are in the {Greaseweazle} folder.
