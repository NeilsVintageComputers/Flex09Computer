ReadmeDisks
The Flex disk images are in SSSD 35track format, the lowest capacity flex format, so can be written to any disk drive you choose to use.  I wrote them to 720k disks using the greaseweazle.
The greaseweazle disk definitions for all the common flex formats are in the {Greaseweazle} folder.
