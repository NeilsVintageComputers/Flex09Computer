There are a lot of Flex disk images on the Internet however as Flex was configured for the hardware it would run on not all will work on any particular system. 
Theoretically any disks that were configured to run on the SWTPC 6809 have a good chance of working on my computer, but even then there are variances in the hardware configuration of a SWTPC system.  
This is just normal for computer systems of this era, so some programs you find will work and some wont, some can be made to work (if you have the skills of the computer enthusiasts of the 80's), some would be very difficult.  
This is a era where you wouldn't say CAN'T be "patched" to work as there were many very clever programmers that could do almost anything if they really needed to !

These are some disk images I have downloaded and checked, but I havn't run every Basic program so can't guarantee that they don't have hardware dependent code in them which was common practice to get the highest performance from low speed processors and 9600baud (or slower!) terminals.

These disks were downloaded, then remastered using Flex 3.0, a good drive, and a new correctly aligned controller.
They are all in 35 Track SSSD, the lowest capacity standard Flex format so should be able to be used with whatever drives your system has. I have used them with 720k drives, only using 35 tracks on one side, and flex interprets them correctly as if coming from a 35 track single sided drive as that is what the formatting information on the disk tells the OS.
